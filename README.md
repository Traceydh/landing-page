# landing-page
The Odin Project foundation course - project landing page 

The aim of this project was to create a landing page with the same format as the one provided using flex box. 

By fiddling and experimenting with flexbox to create this landing page, I now have a better understanding on how to approach future web layouts using flexbox. I've found 
- it's better to draw out grand scheme of flex containers and flex items before starting 
- break up page into manageable sections 
- google is my best friend when encountering new syntax
